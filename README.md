# RL-Min-Implementations
This repository contains minimal implementations for training and testing the most essential RL paradigms. Used as a helpful refresher resource when beginning a new PyTorch RL project. Contains information about how to train basic algorithms like Vanilla Policy Gradient, A2C, PPO and more to come.
